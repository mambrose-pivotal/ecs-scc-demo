# ECS Spring Cloud Connectors Demo

This is a simple example of using EMC ECS S3 for asset storage. It is an image catalog to which you can upload images and see them on the main page.

It is based off of this [Cloud Foundry S3 Demo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-samples/cf-s3-demo) with some
modifications to the connectors to support EMC ECS.
